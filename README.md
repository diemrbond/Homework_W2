# 02 CSS and Bootstrap: Responsive Portfolio

For this project we needed to create a responsive "portfolio" website using Bootstrap, that contained an index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.
As I don't have a useable portfolio yet, I created an image gallery of my family instead.

Minimum Requirements:
```
> Create an index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html
> Use bootstrap
> Include a navbar, responsive layout, responsive images
> Use containers, rows, columns
> Include a mobile layout
> Use an HTML validation service (https://validator.w3.org)
> Bonus, add a sticky footer and use sub-rows/sub-columns
> Commit to github early and often
```
